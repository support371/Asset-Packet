Understood. Your build should prioritize two distinct but integrated experiences:
	1.	A website-first foundation (public site and client-facing flows).
	2.	A dual-dashboard model:
	•	A “Global” dashboard (standardized for everyone).
	•	“Personal” dashboards (admin-created, role-based, and customizable).

Below is a clean, implementation-ready blueprint.

⸻

1) Website-First Build Order

Build the website as the primary product surface, then layer dashboards behind authentication.

Phase 1: Public Website (MVP)

Core pages that establish enterprise credibility:
	•	Home
	•	Services (threat monitoring primary + others as expansions)
	•	Case Studies / Testimonials
	•	Partners / Trust signals
	•	Blog / News
	•	Contact (forms, validation, confirmation, routing)
	•	Privacy / Terms / Accessibility statement

Non-negotiables from your source:
	•	Performance optimization (bundling, caching, SSR where applicable)
	•	Accessibility baseline (semantic HTML, keyboard access, alt text, contrast)
	•	Content maintenance system (review cadence)

Phase 2: Auth + Roles

Before dashboards, implement:
	•	Accounts, organizations (tenant), projects (workspaces)
	•	RBAC roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer, Compliance, Release Manager)
	•	Audit logging (who changed what)

Phase 3: Dashboard Layer
	•	Global dashboard (standard “single pane of glass”)
	•	Personal dashboards (admin-configurable views)

⸻

2) Dual-Dashboard Concept

A) Global Dashboard (for all)

This is the standardized operational view. Every account sees the same baseline modules (permissions-filtered):

Global dashboard widgets (recommended):
	•	Site health: uptime, errors, page speed snapshots
	•	Release status: last deployment, environment health, rollback readiness
	•	Compliance: accessibility score, open issues, critical blockers
	•	Content freshness: overdue pages, upcoming reviews
	•	Traffic/engagement: top pages, bounce spikes

This creates consistency and prevents “everyone building their own truth.”

B) Personal Dashboards (admin-created)

This is where admins can tailor dashboards per:
	•	Person (My Dashboard)
	•	Team (Marketing Dashboard)
	•	Function (Compliance Dashboard)
	•	Project (Client Portal Rollout Dashboard)

Personal dashboards do not replace the Global dashboard; they optimize execution.

3) How Admins Create and Manage Personal Dashboards

You need an admin UX that is simple, controlled, and auditable.

Admin Workflow
	1.	Dashboard Library
	•	List of dashboards: Global (locked), Personal (custom)
	•	Tags: “Marketing,” “Engineering,” “Compliance,” “Client X”
	•	Ownership + last edited + viewers
	2.	Create Dashboard
	•	Name + description
	•	Scope:
	•	Private (only me)
	•	Team (selected roles/users)
	•	Organization-wide (everyone)
	•	Data scope:
	•	All projects
	•	Specific project(s)
	•	Specific environment(s)
	3.	Add Widgets
	•	Widget catalog with categories:
	•	Performance
	•	Accessibility
	•	Content Ops
	•	Deployments
	•	Monitoring
	•	SEO/Growth
	•	Drag-and-drop layout (grid)
	•	Configure per-widget filters (date range, page group, environment)
	4.	Set Rules and Alerts
	•	Thresholds (e.g., Lighthouse drops below X)
	•	SLA alerts (e.g., quarterly review overdue)
	•	Incident triggers (error rate spike)
	5.	Publish + Permissions
	•	View-only vs edit
	•	Role-based access (RBAC)
	•	Approval required for org-wide dashboards (optional but enterprise-friendly)
	6.	Audit + Versioning
	•	Change log for each dashboard
	•	Restore previous versions

This gives admins flexibility without creating governance chaos.

4) Recommended Widget Catalog

These align directly to your source material and keep the dashboards “real” (not vanity metrics).

Performance Widgets
	•	Core Web Vitals trend by page group
	•	Bundle size by route + “unused JS” estimates
	•	Cache compliance report (static assets)
	•	Slow API/DB endpoints leaderboard

Accessibility Widgets
	•	WCAG AA/AAA compliance score
	•	Open a11y issues by severity and page
	•	Keyboard navigation checklist status
	•	Alt-text coverage report

Content Ops Widgets
	•	Pages overdue for review (quarterly)
	•	Blog cadence tracker (weekly/monthly)
	•	Case study/testimonial freshness
	•	Highest-traffic pages needing updates

QA/Launch Widgets
	•	Staging parity checklist completion
	•	Cross-browser/device test status
	•	Load test results and capacity margin
	•	DNS cutover readiness + post-launch watchlist

Monitoring Widgets
	•	Uptime last 7/30/90 days
	•	JS error rate by release version
	•	Incident timeline + open postmortems

⸻

5) Key Governance Rules (So It Stays “Enterprise”)

Tell it like it is: if you allow unlimited customization with no standards, you get dashboard sprawl and conflicting metrics. Prevent that with:
	•	Global dashboard is non-editable (only platform owners can modify).
	•	Personal dashboards are allowed, but:
	•	Must inherit the same metric definitions (“single source of truth”).
	•	Must respect RBAC and data boundaries.
	•	Org-wide dashboards require admin approval (optional but recommended).
	•	Every dashboard change is logged.

⸻

6) The Actual Website-to-Dashboard User Journey
	•	Visitor lands on website → sees credibility, fast load, accessible design
	•	CTA: “Client Portal” / “Sign in”
	•	After login:
	•	Default: Global dashboard
	•	Admins: can also access Dashboard Builder
	•	Users: can pin/favorite dashboards they have access to

⸻

7) MVP Deliverable (Minimal but Strong)

If your primary aim is “build website first,” then the lean MVP dashboard scope should be:
	1.	Global dashboard (standard widgets)
	2.	Dashboard library
	3.	Create dashboard (basic)
	4.	Add widgets + layout
	5.	Permissions (view-only vs edit)
	6.	Audit log (basic)

Everything else (advanced alerts, versioning, A/B testing) can be v2.

⸻

If you want, I can convert this into:
	•	A concrete sitemap (public site + portal routes), and
	•	A dashboard builder screen-by-screen spec (exact fields, buttons, and rules),
in a format your developer team can implement directly.
